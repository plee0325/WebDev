				<p>Also called dakbokkeumtang (닭볶음탕) or dakmaeuntang (닭매운탕), dakdoritang (닭도리탕) is a classic chicken dish that’s cooked in a spicy red sauce along with vegetables such as potatoes, carrots, and onions. The result is succulent pieces of chicken packed with spicy and savory flavors! It’s a highly popular chicken dish both at home and restaurants.</p>
				<p id='ingredientsHeader'>Step 1:</p>
				<p id = 'ingredients'>Prepare the vegetables by cutting up in big chunks.</p>
				<p id='ingredientsHeader'>Step 2:</p>
				<p id='ingredients'>Add 1.5 cups water to a large pot along with the chicken and the sauce (except the sesame oil and sesame seeds). Stir well. Bring it to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.</p>
				<p id='ingredientsHeader'>Step 3:</p>
				<p id = 'ingredients'>Stir in the vegetables (except the scallions). Cover, and cook for an additional 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.</p>
				<p id='ingredientsHeader'>Step 4:</p>
				<p id = 'ingredients'>Continue to cook, uncovered this time, until the chicken is tender and the sauce is slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the scallions, optional chili pepper, sesame oil and sesame seeds right before turning off the heat.</p>
