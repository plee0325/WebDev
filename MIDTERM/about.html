			<h2>My Name is Philip Lee</h2>
			<p>I am living in New York City, pursing an Integrated Design and Media degree at NYU Tandon School of Engineering. As a Korean-American, I fell in love with food anywhere I was finding it. Whether it was at home, eating a homecooked meal cooked by my mom or grandma, or in the great city of New York City completing my bucket list of must-have resturants, food became an important aspect of my life and experiencing good food is one of my greatest joys in life. I discovered early on that I enjoyed making food and watching cooking videos online to learn techniques and how to cook food properly. It was when I went to live on my own in college where I truly could pursue that passion even further. I would invite friends to my apartment almost every weekend and cook meals for 5-10 people. It was then that I realized that I enjoyed cooking for others as much as I enjoyed eating. I hope that these recipes will bring you as much joy as they do for me!</p>
